          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are
          foundational technologies that power the visual and structural aspects
          of websites. In web development, HTML serves as the backbone,
          providing the structural framework for content, such as text, images,
          and links. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by
          tags, defining the structure and hierarchy of a webpage. CSS, on the
          other hand, is responsible for styling and presentation. By applying
          styles to HTML elements, CSS allows developers to control the layout,
          colors, fonts, and overall visual aesthetics of a website. This
          separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) enhances the
          maintainability and scalability of web projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web development, the broader field encompassing HTML and CSS, involves
          creating and maintaining websites or web applications. It extends
          beyond just structure and style, encompassing client-side scripting
          (JavaScript), server-side scripting, and databases. Front-end
          development focuses on the user interface and user experience,
          employing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive and visually
          appealing interfaces. Back-end development involves server-side
          scripting, managing databases, and handling server-related tasks. The
          collaborative integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript results in
          dynamic and engaging web experiences. Responsive web design, a key
          aspect of modern web development, ensures that websites adapt
          seamlessly to different devices and screen sizes, providing a
          consistent and user-friendly experience.

            HTML and CSS allow you to create a cohesive and visually appealing
            webpage. HTML establishes the structure and content hierarchy, while
            CSS brings life to the presentation, making the webpage
            aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.

          <li>
            By structuring your HTML and applying thoughtful CSS styles, you can
            create an engaging and well-designed user interface for your
            website. The collaborative use of these technologies is fundamental
            to the art and science of web development.

        <header><h1>HTML Skeleton</h1></header>

        <p>
          The HTML skeleton serves as the foundational structure for a web page,
          providing the essential framework on which the content and styling are
          built. This skeleton typically includes the basic elements necessary
          for a webpage but does not delve into the specific content or styling
          details.
        </p>
        <p>Key components of the HTML skeleton include:</p>

        <p class="lists">
          <li>
            <strong> Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE): </strong> Declares the
            HTML version being used, ensuring proper rendering by web browsers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML Element:</strong> The root element that encapsulates
            the entire content of the webpage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Head Section:</strong> Contains meta-information about the
            document, such as the character set, title, and links to external
            resources like stylesheets or scripts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Body Section:</strong> Encompasses the main content of the
            webpage, including text, images, links, and other elements visible
            to users.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          By establishing this basic structure, the HTML skeleton provides a
          starting point for developers to organize and arrange content. It also
          serves as the foundation for incorporating CSS styles and JavaScript
          functionality, allowing for a well-organized and semantically
          structured web page. Developers often use templates or frameworks to
          streamline the creation of the HTML skeleton, ensuring consistency
          across multiple pages or projects. This approach facilitates efficient
          development and maintenance by separating the structure from the
          detailed content and design elements.

        <p>
          CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used in web
          development to describe the presentation of a document written in
          HTML. CSS enhances the visual presentation of web pages by allowing
          developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other aspects of
          the design. It works in conjunction with HTML to separate the
          structure (content) from the presentation (style), providing
          flexibility, maintainability, and consistency in web design.

            <strong>Box Model:</strong> The Box Model is fundamental to CSS and
            involves how elements are rendered as boxes on a web page. It
            includes the content area, padding, border, and margin. Developers
            use this technique to control the spacing, sizing, and layout of
            elements.

            <strong> Flexbox:</strong>

            Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that simplifies the design
            of complex layouts and the distribution of space among items in a
            container. It is widely used for creating flexible and responsive
            designs, especially in the context of arranging items in rows or
            columns.

            <strong>Media Queries for Responsive Design:</strong> Media queries
            allow developers to apply different styles based on the
            characteristics of the device or browser window, enabling responsive
            design. This technique is crucial for creating websites that look
            good and function well across a variety of screen sizes, from
            desktops to mobile devices.

          Accessible Navigation refers to the design and implementation of
          navigation elements on a website that ensure equal access and
          usability for all users, including those with disabilities. This
          section of the documentation should cover best practices for creating
          navigation systems that can be easily navigated using screen readers,
          keyboard input, or other assistive technologies. Key considerations
          may include proper semantic HTML, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet
          Applications) roles, and other techniques that enhance the user
          experience for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive
          impairments. The goal is to provide a web navigation experience that
          is inclusive and user-friendly for everyone.
